// Consider the following 3 processes with the length of cpu burst time(in milliseconds). All processes arriving at the same time in order P1, P2, P3 If Round Robin Scheduling is used with time quantum of 1 Unit then average waiting time will be,

// Which module provides control of the CPU to the processes selected by the short-term scheduler?
